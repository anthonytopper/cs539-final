# cs539-final

This project is completed in Python and should be run by running the `train_basic.py` file. The project should be run using Python version 3.

Example command: `python ./train_basic.py`

Note that this file takes a long time to run because it extracts features from over 7,000 audio files
and traings a model based on those features.

This project requires the following libraries:
- Tensorflow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- scipy
- parselmouth 

All of these libraries can be installed through pip.
